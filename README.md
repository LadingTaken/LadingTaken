### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m Nedim Huric, a software engineer student based in Australia.

I design and build whatever I can imagine. I turn my “one day I’ll build this” ideas into real code

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is C, javascript, typescript, nodejs, express and git . My favorite tools are figma, and goodnotes on my iPad.

I possess strong software engineering skills across version control and teamwork, SDLC processes, fullstack project development, software verification, maintainable design, and requirements engineering.


#### Fun Facts:

* I love travelling and discovering new places
* I don’t like coffee 
* **Hobbies:** hiking, gym, building things
